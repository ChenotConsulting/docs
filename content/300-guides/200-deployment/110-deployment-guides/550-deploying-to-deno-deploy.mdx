With this guide, you can learn how to build a simple application and deploy it to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). The application uses Prisma to save a log of each request to a PostgreSQL database.

This guide covers the use of Prisma CLI with Deno CLI, Prisma Client, Data Proxy, and Deno Deploy.

<Admonition type="info">

This guide demonstrates how to deploy an application to Deno Deploy in conjunction with a PostgreSQL database, but you can use [any database type that Prisma supports](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases).

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- a free [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) account
- a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- a PostgreSQL database
- Node.js & npm installed
- git installed
- [Deno installed](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation)

## 1. Set up your application

To start, you create a directory for your project, and then use `deno run` to initialize your application with `prisma init` as an [npm package with npm specifiers](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/node/npm_specifiers).

### Steps

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a location of your choice.
2. Run the following commands to set up your application.

  ```terminal
  mkdir prisma-deno-deploy
  cd prisma-deno-deploy
  deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma init
  ```

3. In the generated `prisma/schema.prisma`, add the following schema:

  ```prisma
  generator client {
    provider        = "prisma-client-js"
    previewFeatures = ["deno"]
    output          = "../generated/client"
  }

  datasource db {
    provider = "postgresql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  }

  model Log {
    id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
    level   Level
    message String
    meta    Json
  }

  enum Level {
    Info
    Warn
    Error
  }
  ```

  This data model defines the `Log` model. Later in the guide, you create an application that uses the `Log` model to store data for incoming requests from the application.

  Note that the `schema.prisma` file includes the preview feature flag `deno` to activate the current preview support for Deno in Prisma Client, and it also defines a custom `output` location for your Prisma Client. This is a requirement for Deno applications.

4. In your `.env` file, replace the current placeholder connection string `postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public` with your PostgreSQL connection string.

## 2. Create the database schema

With the data model in place and your database connection configured, you can now apply the data model to your database.

### Steps

```terminal
deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma db push
```

### Result

With `prisma db push`, you apply the data model in `schema.prisma` to your database.

At this point, this command has 2 additional side effects. The command also installs Prisma Client and creates `package.json` file for the project which includes the `@prisma/client` as a dependency.

## 3. Generate a Prisma Client for Data Proxy

Next, generate Prisma Client for the Data Proxy. You use the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) to connect to your database over HTTP.

```terminal
deno run -A --unstable npm:prisma generate --data-proxy
```

## 4. Create your application and test it locally

You now have a database schema and a generated local Prisma Client. You can now create a local Deno application.

### Steps

Create an `index.ts` with the content listed below.

  ```ts
  import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts'
  import { PrismaClient } from './generated/client/deno/edge.ts'

  const prisma = new PrismaClient()

  async function handler(request: Request) {
    const log = await prisma.log.create({
      data: {
        level: 'Info',
        message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
        meta: {
          headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
        },
      },
    })
    const body = JSON.stringify(log, null, 2)
    return new Response(body, {
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8' },
    })
  }

  serve(handler)
  ```

### What's next

You cannot run this script yet, because you do not yet have the required Data Proxy credentials to use Prisma Client with your database. You obtain the required credentials when you [add your application to the Prisma Data Platform](#6-create-your-project-in-the-prisma-data-platform).

## 5. Create a repository and push to GitHub

Before you add your application to the Prisma Data Platform, create a private repository for your application on GitHub.

### Steps

1. [Create a private GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).
  ![Create a private repository](./550-01-create-repo.png)

2. Initialize your repository locally and push your changes to GitHub.

  ```terminal
  git init -b main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/prisma-deno-deploy
  git add .
  git commit -m "initial commit"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### What's next

You can now import your project into the Prisma Data Platform.

## 6. Create your project in the Prisma Data Platform

Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform and add your application as a project so that you can then enable the [Data Proxy](/data-platform/data-proxy) for the application.

### Steps

1. Sign up for a free [Prisma Data Platform account](https://cloud.prisma.io/).

   <Admonition type="info">

   **Note**<br /><br />
   You need a GitHub account to sign up for the Prisma Data Platform.

   </Admonition>

   ![Signup for Prisma Data Platform](./450-02-signup-pdp.png)

1. Click **New Project**.
1. Connect the Prisma Data Platform to your database and set up the Data Proxy.
    1. Paste your PostgreSQL connection string.
    1. (Optional) If your database provider requires it, for **Static IPs** select **Enabled** to enable connections to your database from static IPs and add them to the database allowlist.
    1. Under **Choose a Data Proxy region**, select a Data Proxy location that is geographically close to your database.
    1. Click **Create project** to test the connection string and to create your project in PDP.
      <img
        src="../../../doc-images/create-01-paste-connection-string.png"
        alt="Prisma Data Platform - Create project - Paste database connection string, select Data Proxy region, enable static IPs"
      />

      If the connection to the database is successful, Prisma Data Platform creates your project and redirects your browser to the **Get started** page.<br /> On the **Get started** page, you can [optionally link your GitHub repository](/data-platform/projects/create#optional-enable-schema-synchronization) and create a Data Proxy connection string.

1. Create a Data Proxy connection string.
    1. On the **Get started** screen, click **Create a new connection string**.
    1. Enter a name for the connection string and click **Create**.
    1. Copy the `prisma://` connection string to your clipboard.

      <img
          src="../../../doc-images/create-03-copy-data-proxy-connection-string.png"
          alt="Prisma Data Platform - Create project - Paste database connection string, select Data Proxy region, enable static IPs"
        />

## 7. Set the Data Proxy Connection string in your environment

With the Data Proxy connection string copied, you can replace the direct PostgreSQL connection string that you used to create the database schema in your `.env` file.

The Data Proxy Client does not read `.env` files by default, so you must run the following command to install `dotenv-cli` locally.

```
npm install dotenv-cli
```

You are now ready to test your script locally.

## 8. Test your script locally

Run and test your script locally.

```terminal
npx dotenv -- deno run -A ./index.ts
```

### Steps

1. In a web browser, open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). This page writes your request to the database.

  ```
  {
    "id": 3,
    "level": "Info",
    "message": "GET http://localhost:8000/",
    "meta": {
      "headers": "{}"
    }
  }
  ```
2. Refresh the page a few times to verify that it's working. If you open the [**Data Browser**](/data-platform/data-browser) for your project in Prisma Data Platform, you can verify that the application writes `Info` logs to your database.

  ![Prisma Data Browser](./450-06-data-browser.png)

### Result

This confirms that the applications works locally.

## 9. Deploy to Deno Deploy

You can now deploy the Deno application to Deno Deploy.

### Steps

1. Go to [https://dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new).
1. Select a GitHub organization or user and then select a repository.
1. Select a production branch and select **Automatic** mode so that Deno Deploy can deploy every time you push a change to the repository.
1. Select `index.ts` as the entry point to your project.
1. To define the Data Proxy connection string, click **Add Env Variable**.
    1. For **KEY**, enter `DATABASE_URL`.
    1. For **VALUE**, paste the Data Proxy connection string.
    ![Deno Deploy - project parameters](images/550-0X-deploy-to-deno-deno-project-parameters.png)
1. Click **Link**.<br />
  Wait for the first Deno deployment to finish.

### Result

When the first deployment finishes, your browser is redirected to the project view.

### What's next

Click the blue **View** button at the top right to open the deployed Deno application.

If all works correctly, you can see the same result as when you tested locally.

```
{
  "id": 5,
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "GET https://prisma-deno-deploy.deno.dev/",
  "meta": {
    "headers": "{}"
  }
}
```

## Summary

You successfully deployed a Deno application that you created in TypeScript and that also uses Prisma Client and the Data Proxy to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
