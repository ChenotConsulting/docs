<!-- TODO: add more to admonition -->

Database views allow you to name and store a query. In relational databases, views are stored queries that may include columns in multiple tables. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

This guide explains how to enable the `views` preview feature and add views to your Prisma schema.

## How to enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

## How to use views in your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword. For example, take the following Prisma schema with a `User` model with a linked `Profile`:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

The following `UserInfo` view combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
view UserInfo {
id    Int    @id
email String
name  String
bio   String
}
```

The corresponding SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW UserInfo AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
```
