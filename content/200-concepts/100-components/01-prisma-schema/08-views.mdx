Database views allow you to name and store a query. In relational databases, views are stored queries that may include columns in multiple tables. In MongoDB, views are queryable objects where the contents are defined by an [aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline) on other collections.

This guide explains how to enable the `views` preview feature and add views to your Prisma schema.

## How to enable the <inlineCode>views</inlineCode> preview feature

Support for views is currently in an early preview. To enable the `views` preview feature, add the `views` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["views"]
}
```

## How to add views to your Prisma schema

To add a view to your Prisma schema, use the `view` keyword. For example, take a `User` model with a linked `Profile`:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio    String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int    @unique
}
```

The following `UserInfo` view combines the `email` and `name` fields from the `User` model and the `bio` field from the `Profile` model:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
view UserInfo {
  id    Int    @id
  email String
  name  String
  bio   String
}
```

The corresponding SQL statement to create this view is:

```sql
CREATE VIEW UserInfo AS
    SELECT u.id, email, name, bio
    FROM "User" u
    LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
```

Introspection of views with `db pull` is currently not supported. Instead, you must manually add views to your Prisma schema.

<Admonition type="warning">

If you introspect an existing schema withÂ views, Prisma will remove them. You need to make sure they are not removed by reverting that change.

## How to use views with Prisma Migrate and <inlineCode>db push</inlineCode>

If you apply changes to your schema with Prisma Migrate or `db push`, Prisma will not create or run any SQL related to views.

To include views in a migration, run `migrate dev --create-only` and then manually add the SQL for views. Alternatively, you can create views manually in the database.

## How to query views in Prisma Client

You can query views in Prisma Client in the same way that you query models.

<!-- TODO: example -->

<!-- TODO: "Right now all views are assumed updateable and Prisma Client will give you all functionality it would give you for normal models" -->
